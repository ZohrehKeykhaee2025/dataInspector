🚀 Why dataInspector?
While R offers several EDA packages, dataInspector provides a unique combination of automated insights and actionable modeling recommendations. Unlike traditional tools that only describe data, our package tells you what to do next with your data.

Key Differentiators:
🔍 Intelligent Modeling Suggestions: Beyond basic statistics, we recommend specific modeling approaches

📊 Integrated Visualization: Automatic plot selection based on data types

⚡ Performance Optimized: Handles large datasets efficiently with smart caching

🎯 Actionable Insights: Direct recommendations for data transformation and preprocessing

📦 Installation
r
# Install from CRAN (coming soon)
# install.packages("dataInspector")

# Install development version from GitHub
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ZohrehKeykhaee2025/dataInspector")

# Load the package
library(dataInspector)
⚡ Quick Start
r
# Load example dataset
data(example_data)

# Generate comprehensive analysis in one line
report <- analyze_dataset(example_data)

# View interactive report
view_report(report)

# Get modeling recommendations
get_recommendations(report)
🎯 Core Features
Automated Data Profiling (report_data())
Comprehensive analysis including:

Structural Overview: Dimensions, memory usage, data types

Missing Value Analysis: Percentage and patterns of missing data

Statistical Summaries: Mean, median, skewness, kurtosis, quartiles

Distribution Analysis: Automated detection of normal/skewed distributions

Outlier Detection: Identification of potential outliers using multiple methods

Intelligent Modeling Recommendations (suggest_approach())
Tailored suggestions including:

Data Transformation Needs: Log, sqrt, or other transformations

Missing Data Handling: Removal vs. imputation recommendations

Model Selection: Appropriate algorithms based on data characteristics

Feature Engineering: Suggestions for creating new features

Automated Visualization (plot_distributions())
Smart visualization capabilities:

Adaptive Plotting: Automatic selection of appropriate plot types

Multi-plot Layouts: Grid arrangements for comparing variables

Interactive Elements: Tooltips and zoom capabilities (optional)

Export Ready: High-quality graphics for publications

📊 Example Dataset
The package includes example_data with realistic data scenarios:

r
# Explore the example dataset
data(example_data)
str(example_data)

# Variable descriptions:
# - normal_var: Normally distributed numeric data (μ=50, σ=10)
# - skewed_var: Right-skewed numeric data (Exponential distribution)
# - category_var: Categorical variable with 3 levels (A, B, C)
# - var_with_missing: Numeric variable with 10% missing values
💻 Usage Examples
Basic Analysis
r
# Quick analysis with default settings
result <- report_data(iris)
print(result)

# Export to various formats
export_report(result, format = "html")
export_report(result, format = "pdf")
Advanced Customization
r
# Custom analysis with specific parameters
detailed_report <- report_data(
  my_dataframe,
  missing_threshold = 0.15,
  outlier_method = "iqr",
  detailed_stats = TRUE
)

# Generate specific visualizations
create_histograms(my_data, columns = c("age", "income"))
create_correlation_matrix(my_data, method = "spearman")
Integration with Modeling Workflow
r
# Complete analysis pipeline
analysis <- analyze_dataset(my_data)

# Apply recommended transformations
transformed_data <- apply_recommendations(my_data, analysis$recommendations)

# Proceed with modeling
model <- train_model(transformed_data, algorithm = "random_forest")
